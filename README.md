pwm-sine-table-generation
=========================

This program will calculate the timer value for PWM sine wave which could be generated using a microcontroller. The inputs are the carrier frequency, sinewave frequency and minimum and maximum value of counters. It outputs the sine table value in a file which could be readly copied to an array.
